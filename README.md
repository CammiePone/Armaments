Armaments adds a handful of new items and mechanics to improve parts of combat that are either niche or not worth while.

### Changes
```
Goat Horns - when blown on horseback, your horse will get Speed 2 for 30 seconds and Resistance 1 for 15 seconds.
Channeling - can now strike lightning in all rain, not just thunderstorms. Lightning from channeling will not ignite blocks or destroy items.
Riptide - can now be used while wearing a Sea Crown.
```

### Additions
```
Sea Crown - gives the wearer -2 HP but can be crafted with a potion to give the wearer the effects infinitely with an amplifier of 0. It provides no protection.
Crystal Spear - charges up its base damage over 2 seconds while charging forward on horseback, capping at 20 damage.
Echo Dagger - when fueled by an Echo Shard, it will cause all damage and healing to "echo" against the target of choice, halving the amount each time until it fizzles out.
Elder Guardian Spike - drops from an Elder Guardian, it has a really fast attack speed but low damage and low durability. It pierces protection enchantments, and is used to craft the Sea Crown.
